# Junkathon

First prize winning submission for the BostonHacks Junkathon 2019 - hackathon for the worst ideas!

## What is the hardest part of studying?
Distraction, right?
My teammate and I thought a great idea for a bad idea hackathon would be to make peoples' lives harder by distracting them when they try to study!

## Presenting FocusNot, a Chrome extension designed to distract!

You want to study? Challenge accepted! If you have this extension enabled, you'll be bombarded with memes every few minutes to keep you from getting your work done.

Let's see how you study now.

## Project Execution

The .crx file is the packed extension and the folder “FocusNot” is the unpacked version that can be run when developer mode is enabled on Chrome.

Follow the steps mentioned here to enable developer mode in Google Chrome
